The document is as follows: 'The company has supplier finance programs with third-party financial institutions where the company agrees to pay the financial institutions the stated amounts of invoices from participating suppliers on the originally invoiced maturity date, which have an average term of 90 to 120 days, consistent with the company's standard payment terms. The financial institutions offer earlier payment of the invoices at the sole discretion of the supplier for a discounted amount. The company does not provide secured legal assets or other forms of guarantees under the arrangements. The company is not a party to the arrangements between its suppliers and the financial institutions. These obligations are recognized as accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

IBM, in order to comply with these legal requirements, must ascertain whether someone who may be given access to restricted technology is a “Foreign Person” subject to these export control restrictions. If someone is a Foreign Person for export control purposes, then he/she may need to be granted an export license or other government authorization before starting in a position with access to restricted technology.

In the opinion of the company’s management, these statements include all adjustments, which are only of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present a fair statement of the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and other comprehensive income/(loss) that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events, historical experience, actions that the company may undertake in the future and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. As a result, actual results may be different from these estimates.\n\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the company reported a provision for income taxes of $389 million and a benefit from income taxes of $112 million, respectively, and the effective tax rate was 17.5 percent and (3.4) percent, respectively. The benefit from income taxes in the six months ended June 30, 2024, was primarily driven by the resolution of certain tax audit matters in the first quarter. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the company reported a provision for income taxes of $419 million and $543 million, respectively, and the effective tax rate was 21.0 percent and 17.8 percent, respectively.
