The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of adrenomedullin on angiotensin II and adrenocorticotrophic hormone-stimulated aldosterone production in vivo in healthy humans. Seven volunteers were studied in a quiet, temperature-controlled laboratory. After 35 min of rest, an infusion of placebo or adrenomedullin (3 pmol\/kg per min) was given over 60 min; 15 min after starting this first infusion, a second infusion of angiotensin II (0.96 fmol\/kg per min) or adrenocorticotrophic hormone (0.1 mIU\/kg per min) was co-infused and continued for 45 min. Adrenomedullin significantly inhibited angiotensin II stimulated aldosterone production: the increment in aldosterone on the placebo day was 691 pmol\/l compared with 552 pmol\/l on the adrenomedullin day (P< 0.004). Adrenomedullin did not inhibit adrenocorticotrophic hormone-stimulated aldosterone or cortisol release.\n\n ### Output"

# I hope this has been a low stress experience....every question you nor I could or would ask can actually lead to a review of your medical status and problems....there can be many reasons why you are feeling worthless.Sometimes it is an indication of clinical depression.And usually your thoughts are not realistic.For example, \"I should not be here\".One of the things that frequently triggers depression is: change and unknown situations.If you are trying to work yourself through these feelings is okay....it may just take some time....the important thing is not letting the \"little ones\" get to you.....you are worth a whole lot more than they think....and if they can't feel that then find someone who does.
